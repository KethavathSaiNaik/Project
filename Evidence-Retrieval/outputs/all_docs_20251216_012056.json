      "text": "Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance."

      "text": "In machine learning, deep learning focuses on utilizing multilayered neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning. The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and revolves around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised."

      "text": "The objective of cancer screening is to detect cancer before symptoms appear, involving various methods such as blood tests, urine tests, DNA tests, and medical imaging. The purpose of screening is early cancer detection, to make the cancer easier to treat and extending life expectancy. In 2019, cancer was the second leading cause of death globally; more recent data is pending due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "title": "Gene expression",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression",
      "text": "Gene expression is the process by which the information contained within a gene is used to produce a functional gene product, such as a protein or a functional RNA molecule. This process involves multiple steps, including the transcription of the gene's sequence into RNA. For protein-coding genes, this RNA is further translated into a chain of amino acids that folds into a protein, while for non-coding genes, the resulting RNA itself serves a functional role in the cell. Gene expression enables cells to utilize the genetic information in genes to carry out a wide range of biological functions. While expression levels can be regulated in response to cellular needs and environmental changes, some genes are expressed continuously with little variation."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_programming",
      "text": "Gene expression programming (GEP) in computer programming is an evolutionary algorithm that creates computer programs or models. These computer programs are complex tree structures that learn and adapt by changing their sizes, shapes, and composition, much like a living organism. And like living organisms, the computer programs of GEP are also encoded in simple linear chromosomes of fixed length. Thus, GEP is a genotype–phenotype system, benefiting from a simple genome to keep and transmit the genetic information and a complex phenotype to explore the environment and adapt to it."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression",
      "text": "Regulation of gene expression, or gene regulation, includes a wide range of mechanisms that are used by cells to increase or decrease the production of specific gene products. Sophisticated programs of gene expression are widely observed in biology, for example to trigger developmental pathways, respond to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food sources. Virtually any step of gene expression can be modulated, from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the post-translational modification of a protein. Often, one gene regulator controls another, and so on, in a gene regulatory network."

      "text": "In the field of molecular biology, gene expression profiling is the measurement of the activity of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function. These profiles can, for example, distinguish between cells that are actively dividing, or show how the cells react to a particular treatment. Many experiments of this sort measure an entire genome simultaneously, that is, every gene present in a particular cell."

      "text": "Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a gene expression technique used in molecular biology to produce a snapshot of the 5′ end of the messenger RNA population in a biological sample. The small fragments from the very beginnings of mRNAs are extracted, reverse-transcribed to cDNA, PCR amplified and sequenced. CAGE was first published by Hayashizaki, Carninci and co-workers in 2003.\nCAGE has been extensively used within the FANTOM research projects."

CHAID and CART provided the highest and most stable sensitivity, accuracy and discriminatory power, while artificial neural networks performed well but required more complex calibration. Discriminant analysis consistently ranked as the weakest method, reinforcing concerns about relying on older statistical techniques in unpredictable economic environments."
