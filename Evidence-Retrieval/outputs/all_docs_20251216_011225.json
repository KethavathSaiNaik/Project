      "title": "Gene expression",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression",
      "text": "Gene expression is the process by which the information contained within a gene is used to produce a functional gene product, such as a protein or a functional RNA molecule. This process involves multiple steps, including the transcription of the gene's sequence into RNA. For protein-coding genes, this RNA is further translated into a chain of amino acids that folds into a protein, while for non-coding genes, the resulting RNA itself serves a functional role in the cell. Gene expression enables cells to utilize the genetic information in genes to carry out a wide range of biological functions. While expression levels can be regulated in response to cellular needs and environmental changes, some genes are expressed continuously with little variation."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_programming",
      "text": "Gene expression programming (GEP) in computer programming is an evolutionary algorithm that creates computer programs or models. These computer programs are complex tree structures that learn and adapt by changing their sizes, shapes, and composition, much like a living organism. And like living organisms, the computer programs of GEP are also encoded in simple linear chromosomes of fixed length. Thus, GEP is a genotype–phenotype system, benefiting from a simple genome to keep and transmit the genetic information and a complex phenotype to explore the environment and adapt to it."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression",
      "text": "Regulation of gene expression, or gene regulation, includes a wide range of mechanisms that are used by cells to increase or decrease the production of specific gene products. Sophisticated programs of gene expression are widely observed in biology, for example to trigger developmental pathways, respond to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food sources. Virtually any step of gene expression can be modulated, from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the post-translational modification of a protein. Often, one gene regulator controls another, and so on, in a gene regulatory network."

      "text": "In the field of molecular biology, gene expression profiling is the measurement of the activity of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function. These profiles can, for example, distinguish between cells that are actively dividing, or show how the cells react to a particular treatment. Many experiments of this sort measure an entire genome simultaneously, that is, every gene present in a particular cell."

      "text": "Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a gene expression technique used in molecular biology to produce a snapshot of the 5′ end of the messenger RNA population in a biological sample. The small fragments from the very beginnings of mRNAs are extracted, reverse-transcribed to cDNA, PCR amplified and sequenced. CAGE was first published by Hayashizaki, Carninci and co-workers in 2003.\nCAGE has been extensively used within the FANTOM research projects."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_co-expression_network",
      "text": "A gene co-expression network (GCN) is an undirected graph, where each node corresponds to a gene, and a pair of nodes is connected with an edge if there is a significant co-expression relationship between them. Having gene expression profiles of a number of genes for several samples or experimental conditions, a gene co-expression network can be constructed by looking for pairs of genes which show a similar expression pattern across samples, since the transcript levels of two co-expressed genes rise and fall together across samples. Gene co-expression networks are of biological interest since co-expressed genes are controlled by the same transcriptional regulatory program, functionally related, or members of the same pathway or protein complex."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatiotemporal_gene_expression",
      "text": "Spatiotemporal gene expression is the activation of genes within specific tissues of an organism at specific times during development. Gene activation patterns vary widely in complexity. Some are straightforward and static, such as the pattern of tubulin, which is expressed in all cells at all times in life. Some, on the other hand, are extraordinarily intricate and difficult to predict and model, with expression fluctuating wildly from minute to minute or from cell to cell. Spatiotemporal variation plays a key role in generating the diversity of cell types found in developed organisms; since the identity of a cell is specified by the collection of genes actively expressed within that cell, if gene expression was uniform spatially and temporally, there could be at most one kind of cell."

      "text": "In molecular biology, housekeeping genes are typically constitutive genes that are required for the maintenance of basic cellular function, and are expressed in all cells of an organism under normal and patho-physiological conditions. Although some housekeeping genes are expressed at relatively constant rates in most non-pathological situations, the expression of other housekeeping genes may vary depending on experimental conditions."
