      "text": "A brain tumor occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes. Other symptoms may include difficulty walking, speaking, with sensations, or unconsciousness.",

A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes as well as its hierarchical, three-dimensional structural configuration. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism's genes, their interrelations and influence on the organism. Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain.",

As resistance patterns continue to evolve and spread, traditional surveillance methods struggle to keep pace with the complexity and scale of the issue. Genomic surveillance, particularly when integrated with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, offers a powerful solution to track, predict, and mitigate the emergence of resistant bacterial strains. This paper explores the role of AI in genomic surveillance, highlighting how machine learning and deep learning algorithms can analyze vast genomic datasets to identify resistance genes, mutations, and emerging resistance trends. By combining genomic, clinical, and environmental data, AI-powered models can predict resistance patterns, enabling early detection and more targeted public health interventions. The paper examines various AI techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and their application in forecasting antibiotic resistance in pathogens like Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite the promising potential, challenges such as data quality, model generalizability, and ethical concerns persist. Nevertheless, the integration of AI into genomic surveillance holds transformative potential for enhancing global efforts to combat AMR, providing real-time insights and more effective strategies for antibiotic stewardship. The paper concludes by discussing future directions for AI in genomic surveillance, emphasizing the need for further research, collaboration, and global data sharing to improve predictive capabilities and combat antibiotic resistance effectively.",

      "text": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10%, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and rapid disease progression. Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes, yet current diagnostic methods lack the sensitivity and specificity needed for effective screening. This review explores the integration of advanced imaging techniques with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the early detection of pancreatic cancer. Emphasizing a biological approach, we examine the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer and how they manifest in imaging data. Key imaging modalities, including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET), are evaluated for their efficacy in visualizing pancreatic abnormalities. AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning, are discussed in the context of their ability to analyze complex imaging datasets, identify subtle biomarkers, and predict disease onset with high accuracy. We delve into the biological markers that AI algorithms can detect, such as changes in the tumor microenvironment, alterations in tissue architecture, and specific molecular signatures of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Furthermore, the integration of AI with molecular imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), is explored to provide a multi-faceted approach to early diagnosis. The review also highlights the potential of combining AI-driven imaging with liquid biopsies and genomics to create a comprehensive diagnostic framework. By leveraging the power of AI to interpret complex biological data, we propose a novel paradigm for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, aiming to improve screening protocols, enable timely therapeutic interventions, and ultimately enhance patient survival rates. In supposition, the integration of AI with advanced imaging techniques holds significant promise for revolutionizing the early detection of pancreatic cancer. Continued research and clinical validation are essential to translate these technological advancements into routine clinical practice, offering hope for better prognostic outcomes in patients with this devastating disease.",

      "text": "Analyzing genomic data at scale would be nearly impossible without cost-efficient mechanisms working in the background to make such analysis accessible to all. This reality highlights the exciting potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which are ushering in a new era of genomic research grounded in precision medicine. AI and ML have introduced novel approaches to handle the massive volumes of genomic data, uncovering complex biological and genetic patterns that traditional methods often struggle to interpret. This integration not only deepens our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of diseases but also accelerates the development of personalized diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies. These technologies have dramatically improved the affordability, speed, and accuracy of genomic sequencing analysis. Deep learning models can now process raw sequence data in detail, identifying mutations, structural variations, and gene expressions with remarkable precision. These advanced systems analyze millions of data points to predict disease risks, determine the most effective treatments, anticipate drug side effects, and help clinicians create personalized care plans. In fields like oncology, AI-powered tools are narrowing down potential biomarkers for complex diseases—such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders—enabling earlier diagnoses and more targeted therapies. ML is also revolutionizing pharmacogenomics by identifying how genetic profiles influence drug responses. This reduces the guesswork in drug selection, lowers the risk of side effects, and improves overall treatment outcomes. Specifically in cancer treatment, ML models are helping oncologists design personalized treatment regimens based on the unique genetic makeup of a tumor, ultimately improving disease management and survival rates. Moreover, AI and ML play a crucial role in integrating multi-omics data— including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—to provide a comprehensive view of disease mechanisms. These integrative approaches are vital for understanding how genes and their expressions shape biological functions and disease states. Across the biomedical field, these AI-driven systems are powering tools that help clinicians and researchers keep up with the latest scientific breakthroughs and medical guidelines, through automated literature mining and clinical decision support.",

      "text": "\n Study of early pancreas neoplasia in humans had previously been limited by lack of available tissue. Recent work by our group on deceased donor pancreata identified pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions in non-diseased organs and defined a transcriptomic signature for the microenvironment of these pre-cancerous lesions. Prevalence of PanINs in healthy human tissue was higher than expected and established a novel model to expand understanding of the complex biology of these precursor lesions. Epigenetic changes in chromatin structure and the subsequent effects on gene expression are essential processes in neoplasia that have yet to be described at the single cell level in the human pancreas. We hypothesized that previously defined gene signatures could identify acinar, ductal, and PanIN cells in donor pancreata based on chromatin accessibility profiling by single nuclear transposase-accessible chromatin preparation followed by high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-seq). Comparison between the accessibility patterns, transcription factor motifs, and differences in accessibility versus expression profiles can then be used to expand prior knowledge of early pancreatic neoplasia and identify novel targets for further study and therapy selection. To test this hypothesis, single nuclei from seventeen donor pancreata (twenty total samples) were isolated for snATAC-seq using the 10x Genomics platform. Data analysis was conducted using CellRanger, Seurat, Signac, AUCell, and other programs to identify and label chromatin peaks in individual nuclei corresponding to acinar, ductal, and PanIN origin according to gene signatures identified by scRNA-seq and special transcriptomics on matched donor pancreata. Using this method, cells corresponding to these gene signatures, including PanIN- like cells, were indeed identifiable with differentially accessible regions of the genome then analyzed for transcription factor motif enrichment between these cell types. Motifs enriched in cells identified as PanINs compared to either ductal or acinar cells included several transcription factors implicated in tumorigenesis. These results are similar to previously demonstrated essential factors in pancreatic neoplasia, suggesting this strategy is a relevant method for data analysis and discovery of novel factors implicated in tumorigenesis. Ongoing studies include validation of these findings in vitro using human pancreatic normal epithelial cells, human tumor cell lines, and organoid models derived from human normal and tumor samples. Together, this study demonstrates that PanINs can be identified in human pancreas tissue by snATAC-seq and that differentially expressed motifs can be identified, providing opportunity for further integration with transcriptomic information to elucidate detailed understanding of early neoplasia in the pancreas for future drug development and targeted therapeutics studies.\n Citation Format: Jamie N Mills, Aaron Dendekker, Joyce K Thompson, Hannah Watkoske, Simone Benitz, Padma Kadiyala, Ahmed Elhossiny, Howard Crawford, Eileen Carpenter, Marina Pasca di Magliano, Filip Bednar.

      "text": "\n \n \n Obesity is a known risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Specifically, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) can contribute to tumor development through mechanisms such as adipokine secretion and insulin resistance. With aging, changes in VAT composition are accompanied by shifts in its metabolic and immune functions, potentially altering its interaction with adjacent tumors. These age-related differences may influence CRC development and progression and give rise to early-onset CRC (EOCRC), defined as those diagnosed before the age of 50. To explore this, we examined how visceral fat area (VFA), used as a validated proxy for total VAT volume, relates to VAT gene expression in CRC patients, and whether these associations differed by age at diagnosis.\n \n \n \n Tumor-adjacent VAT was collected in 88 stage I-III CRC patients undergoing primary surgery as part of the ColoCare Study at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI), University of Utah, and Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany. RNA sequencing was performed on VAT at the HCI genomics core. VFA was quantified from computed tomography (CT) scans, derived from a single-slice CT image at the L3 level, and categorized, as based on median VFA value, [CU1] as low (<196 cm2) or high (≥196 cm2). We assessed differential[CU2] gene expression in relation to high vs. low VFA within each age stratum (<50 years and ≥50 years), adjusting for study site, sex, tumor stage, and tumor site. Ranked genes were analyzed with GSEA software to identify enriched gene sets and pathways.\n \n \n \n Of 88 patients, 10 were EOCRC (median age 46, SD 8.3) and 78 w[PE3] [PE4] [PE5] ere later-onset CRC (LOCRC, median age 67, SD 15.8). Among EOCRC patients, 60% had low VFA (<196 cm2), while in the LOCRC group, 47% had low VFA (≥196 cm2). GSEA identified several immune-related pathways positively enriched among genes upregulated in high vs low VFA within both age strata. Notably, Hematopoietic Cell Lineage was concordantly enriched in both EOCRC and LOCRC. Age-specific patterns emerged: extracellular matrix and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways were predominantly enriched in LOCRC patients, whereas adaptive immune signaling and immunodeficiency pathways were specific to EOCRC patients.\n \n \n \n High VFA is associated with distinct VAT gene expression profiles in CRC patients, and age-specific pathways emerged. These findings indicate that VAT may modulate CRC biology in an age-dependent manner, potentially contributing to the development of EOCRC.\n \n \n \n Patricia A. Erickson, Victoria M.
